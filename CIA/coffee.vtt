If your morning starts with the smell of fresh coffee, you're a true believer.

00:04.160 --> 00:07.440
If you know your beans from your blends, you're one of us.

00:07.440 --> 00:11.520
And if you can't imagine a world without your daily cup, well, this story's for you.

00:12.320 --> 00:16.800
Coffee's journey began over a thousand years ago in Ethiopia, where legend says

00:16.800 --> 00:22.000
Goatherders first discovered its energizing effects. From there it traveled to Yemen,

00:22.000 --> 00:27.440
sparking the world's first coffee houses, places where ideas percolated as quickly as the brew.

00:28.080 --> 00:33.520
By the 17th century, coffee had conquered Europe, fueling artists, thinkers, and revolutionaries.

00:34.160 --> 00:39.760
Fast forward to today and coffee culture is everywhere, from bustling Italian espresso bars

00:39.760 --> 00:45.440
to hipster cafes in Tokyo. It's a global language connecting people from all walks of life

00:45.440 --> 00:50.160
over a simple cup. So next time you sip, remember you're part of a century's old tradition.

00:50.960 --> 00:55.840
Cheers to coffee, the drink that shaped history and still brings us together, one cup at a time.
