00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960
Did you know that there is a disaster risk
reduction and management in Bicol

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.120
University Polangie Campus? If yes, good
for you.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.380
And if no, you better know. Are you
prepared?

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.720
What if this happens? Are you sure that
the knowledge you have right now is

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.520
enough to make you safe during disasters?
What should we

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.160
do during disaster? It is important to
know the kinds of

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.700
disaster that can happen where you live
and where your children go to school or

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.460
work. The best way to learn is to ask
questions.

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:41.980
What are the types of disaster? We have
typhoons,

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.060
earthquakes, flood, volcanic eruption.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.060
What if we are inside the campus? Here are
some measures before,

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.820
during, and after that you need to take
note of.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.500
But first, let me introduce you to the
BUPC map.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.600
What is the use of the BUPC map? The BUPC
map will

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.120
guide you to the possible exits or the
safe places within the campus

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.000
when a disaster occurs. During an
earthquake, we can use

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.920
the open spaces of the buildings in the
campus, just like the soccer field and

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.680
in front of the administration building.
For typhoons,

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.460
we can make use of the SB buildings for
the evacuation center.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.560
You can use all the rooms except the
offices and the laboratory areas.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.460
So what are the calamities we should be
prepared of?

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.740
Actually, we should be prepared for all of
them. Let's

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.540
start with earthquakes. Remember, drop,

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.660
cover, and hold on. During an earthquake,
first,

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.880
be calm. Be alert and don't panic. Quickly
open the door if

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.660
possible. Dock under a sturdy table or
desk. Cover

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.400
and hold on to it to protect your head.
Stay away from windows,

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.200
bookcases, bookshelves, heavy mirrors,
hanging plants,

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.340
fans, and other heavy objects. Stay
undercover till the shaking

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.100
stops. After tremors subside, exit your
home or school

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.680
building and move to open fields. If the
FIVOX

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.520
announces that there is Alert Level 1 and
you're still in the campus,

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.560
don't you worry. Our school is far and
safe from the 6-kilometer

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.360
danger zone. When there is flood while
you're still in the campus,

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.940
stay tuned to the announcements for
further information and instructions.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.680
If you are ordered to evacuate, do not
walk through

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.800
flowing water. Drowning is the number one
cause of flood deaths.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.580
Most of these drownings occur during flash
floods. Follow the

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.240
designated evacuation procedure. Stay
alert and

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.840
awake. Be aware that intense, short bursts
of rain may be

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.500
particularly dangerous, especially after
longer periods of heavy rainfall

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.280
and damp weather. Be alert. Know the
safest place and the

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.100
exits in your area. Don't be hysterical
and think of what you should do

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.840
first for you to be able to survive. When
you're in the nursing department,

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.100
you are in the farthest in all departments
so you can take this way.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.820
If you're in technology department, take
this way.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.220
And if you're in CESD department, this
leads the way.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.860
For the students who's in SB department,
you're nearest in the exit.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.180
Don't panic. You're gonna leave the place
safe. In case of

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.920
emergencies, you should know the emergency
hotlines in your area.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.960
In BUPC, we have these hotlines.

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:06.480
Being prepared is better than being sorry.
The students,

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.560
faculty, and administration in BUPC should
be prepared in any

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.440
natural disaster. This is a reminder from
us to stay safe

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.260
and be knowledgeable of these disasters.
It can take time,

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.820
but it can help you in the near future. Be
informed.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.440
Be prepared. And rise above any disaster.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.540
Be prepared. Take care.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.120
Be prepared. Thank you. Thank you. Thank
you. Thank you.
